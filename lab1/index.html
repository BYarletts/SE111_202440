        <p>
            I am currently a 19 year old studying software engineering even though my parents say everyday that it won't take me anywhere in live I still persevere through and try the best I can.
             And I think thats what makes me what I am today. No matter what people said throughtout my entire high school career or even my life I just always just got through it. I like to say sometimes its one of my superpowers because everytime you see me out and about or even in class I look fine but sometimes im not.
